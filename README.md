  I work as a Developer Advocate at Red Hat. I live and work in Los Angeles 🇺🇸, but I was born and raised in Ireland 🇮🇪.
  
  Seems like everyone has a fancy README on their profile these days, doesn't it? Here's my take on the trend; a README that automatically updates at ~0600 UTC every day to provide you with some insight into things I'm up to.
